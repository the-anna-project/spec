// LayerService provides business logic to manage connections inside network
// layers. There are three different kinds of layer service implementations in
// use. Each implementation takes care about connections between peers within
// the layer of its own responsibility. Connections across layers can be managed
// using the plain usage of the connection service (see ConnectionService).
//
//     behaviour
//
//         The behaviour layer service manages connections of the behaviour
//         layer of the connection space. Subject of this layer are connections
//         between behaviours. Note that behaviour is implemented in form of CLG
//         services (see CLGService).
//
//     information
//
//         The information layer service manages connections of the information
//         layer of the connection space. Subject of this layer are connections
//         between information. Note that information are provided in form of
//         input, which is received via input services (see InputService).
//
//     position
//
//         The position layer service manages connections of the position layer
//         of the connection space. Subject of this layer are connections
//         between positions. Note that positions are managed implicitely, which
//         means that the position layer service is used by the behaviour and
//         information layer services. Positions of peers need to be managed for
//         all kinds of peers within the connection space.
