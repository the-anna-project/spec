// received it is injected into the neural communication. The following neural
// activity calculates outputs which are streamed through the output channel
// back to the requestor.

	// ActivatorService.Activate. This is how it might look like when a CLG is
	// requested and multiple CLGs forward signals to it.

	// Forward is triggered after the CLGs calculation. Here will be decided what

	// one or more CLGs. All this depends on the information provided by the given
	// network payload, the CLG's connections and its therefore resulting
	// behaviour properties. This is how it might look like when one CLG forwards
	// signals to multiple other CLGs.
